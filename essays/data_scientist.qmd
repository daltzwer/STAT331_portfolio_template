title: "My Growth as a Data Scientist"

I don't necessarily know if I am comfortable calling myself a data scientist quite yet but looking back on this quarter, I can honestly say that I have been incredibly proud of my growth as a computer programmer. I remember feeling frustrated during lab 3 because I was not only having a difficult time learning each different DPLYR verbs/functions but even more difficult was finding the right combination of these functions. These difficulties kind of highlight the challenges I experienced during the early stages of the quarter; I simply did not know enough about computer programming, much less R. However, as the quarter went on, my skills and confidence continued to grow. This was most evident during our most recent Challenge assignment; Challenge 9 Before Table Formatting. I remember going through this with relative ease, being able to visualize how I want my final table or graph to look like and knew how I wanted to get there. Not only that, but I was also able to include a little bit of creativity in my graphs through searching on Google which has been an area of programming that I avoided due to my lack of confidence and fear of crashing the entire project. It may have taken me all quarter, but I think Week 9 is when it really clicked for me how valuable a skill programming truly is and how it directly applies to my major and future career.
