[**My Grade:**]{.underline} I believe my grade equivalent to course work evidenced below to be a B. So far in our quarter, I feel I have already improved so much on my coding skills and have felt quite proud of what I have been able to accomplish thus far. However, I also recognize that my current skill set and programming knowledge is not up to par to an A or even a solid B yet based on the grading guidelines we developed in class.

[**Learning Objective Evidence:**]{.underline} In the code chunks below, provide code from a Lab or Challenge assignment where you believe you have demonstrated proficiency with the specified learning target. Be sure to specify **where** the code came from (e.g., Lab 4 Question 2).

## Reproducibility

**R-1: I can create professional looking, reproducible analyses using RStudio projects, Quarto documents, and the here package.**

I've done this in the following provided assignments: lab 4

**R-2: I can write well documented and tidy code.**

-   Example 1 Lab 2 Question 8

```{r r-2-1}
# Code for question 8 (and 9 and 10 and 11 and 12)! :) 
ggplot(data = surveys,
       mapping = aes(x = species, y = weight)) + 
   #changing color of all points
  geom_jitter(color = "lightblue", alpha = 0.2) +  
  #getting rid of outliers from boxplot graph 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) 
```

-   Example 2 Lab 5 Question 3.1

```{r r-2-2}
ggplot(data = Captured, 
       mapping = aes(x = day_of_week, 
                     y = n, 
                     fill = day_of_week)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Day of the Week Captured", 
       y = "Total Amount of Rodents Captured", 
       fill = "Day of the Week")
```

**R-3: I can write robust programs that are resistant to changes in inputs.**

-   Example 1 Lab 4 Question 5

```{r r-3-1}
top_five <- avocado_metro|>
  group_by(region) |>
  summarise(avg_sales = mean(`Total Volume`)) |>
  slice_max(avg_sales, n= 5) |>
  pull(region)
  

avocado_metro |>
  filter(region %in% top_five)|>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = region, y = `Total Volume`)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", colour = "darkgreen") +
  labs(x = "Metro Regions", y = "Total Number of Avocados Sold")

```

-   Example 2 Lab 4 Question 3

```{r r-3-2}
avocado_major |>
  filter(type == "organic", year == "2017") |>
  select(Smalls, region) |>
  group_by(region) |>
  summarise(total_small_sold = sum(Smalls))

## Program Efficiency

**PE-1: I can write concise code which does not repeat itself.**

-   using a single function call Lab 7 question 3.1

```{r pe-1-one-call}
rescale_01 <- function(x) {
  scaled <- (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))
  
  
  return(scaled)
}

```

-   `across()` Lab 7 Question 2.1

```{r pe-1-across}
fish |> 
  summarise(across(.cols = trip:species, 
                   .fns = ~ sum(is.na(.x))))
```

-   `map()` functions lab 8 question 2

```{r pe-1-map-1}
1:12 |>
  map(function(x)
sing_day(xmas2, x, "Full.Phrase"))

```

rescale_01 <- function(x) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
  stopifnot(length(x) > 1)
  scaled <- (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) / (max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE))
  
  
  return(scaled)
}

```

**PE-3:I can use iteration to reduce repetition in my code.**

-   `across()` Lab 7 Question 3.5

```{r pe-3-across}
rescale_column <- function(df, column_names){
  
  df <- df |>

## Data Simulation & Modeling

**DSM-1: I can simulate data from a *variety* of probability models.**

-   Example 1 Practice Activity 9.2

```{r dsm-1-1}
qunif(0.95, 1.5, 3.5)

```

-   Example 2

```{r dsm-1-2}
qnorm(0.1, 4.6, 0.8)
```

**DSM-2: I can fit a linear regression and extract necessary summary measures.**

-   Example 1 Lab 9 Question 4.1

```{r dsm-2-1}
Allison_lm <- lm(Count ~ Year, data = allison_f_year)
Allison_lm
```

-   Example 2 Practice Activity 9.1

```{r dsm-2-2}
animal_lm <- animal |>
  lm(weight_after ~ weight_before, data = _)
```

## Revising My Thinking

<!-- How did you revise your thinking throughout the course? How did you revise your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

So far in our class, I have done most of the revisions that I have been allowed to do. I also believe that I have incorporated most of the feedback I have received into my future projects in hopes of applying the new skill I just learned. One opportunity I believe I have is that I am not consistent enough in applying some of the feedback I have received. This is often due to me rushing to make our deadline and forgetting to double check my work before submitting. With a little more repetition and finding a way to be more efficient, I believe I can further improve upon this opportunity before the quarter ends. As the quarter progressed, I believed I have showcased a better understanding of coding and what it takes to write tidy and efficient code.

## Extending My Thinking

<!-- How did you extended your thinking throughout the course? How did you extend your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

This is where I believe my greatest opportunity lies. Thus far, I rarely go above and beyond due to a fear of messing up my whole project entirely. With a very limited background in computer programming, I am under the misconception that I do not currently have the skill set to be able to go above and beyond in our labs and challenges. I do, however, often research possible solutions to my problems and cite it appropriately in my projects. I also regularly go to tutoring hours in hopes of improving on the efficiency of my code and my overall understanding of the concepts we are learning in class. Additionally, I try to incorporate what we learned from our previous labs into our current projects.

## Peer Support & Collaboration

Similar to what I wrote in the "Extending My Thinking" section of our reflection, often times, I find myself hesitant to provide more useful feedback due to my fear of giving the wrong answer. Despite my limited knowledge and skill set, however, I believe I have done well in this aspect of our class. I complete our weekly Peer Reviews on time while trying to be as detailed as I can about the things my peer should keep doing or improve upon. In our groups, I have acted on my role as best as I can without going into someone's role while being patient and respectful. I try to clarify any ambiguity my group members may have when I can and help debug their code for our lab assignments. I will, however, admit that I feel that I have not been carrying my own weight in our practice activities due to my limited skill set. I am unsure if this is an accurate depiction of our group situation but I would like to continue improving on this department so I can contribute a little more in our group projects and better support my group members.
